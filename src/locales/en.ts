      longDescription:
        "<p>I help you choose computer hardware so you can feel confident you're buying exactly what you need — <strong>without overpaying</strong>, without frustrating compromises, and without spending hours digging through conflicting advice online.</p><p>I treat consulting like a real project: first I understand your goals and priorities, then I design a setup (or an upgrade path) that stays fast, stable, and well-balanced for years.</p><p>I start by analyzing how you actually use your PC:</p><ul><li>Gaming — which titles and what resolution</li><li>Work — Adobe apps, 3D, CAD, programming, data analysis</li><li>Studying, streaming</li><li>Monitor and peripherals</li><li>Preferences — low noise, good temperatures, case size, future upgradability</li></ul><p>That's why my recommendations aren't generic parts lists, but <strong>tailored solutions</strong> with clear reasoning.</p><p>Based on that, I compare components and suggest the best options within your budget: CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, PSU, cooling, and case. I verify compatibility and pay attention to details that people often miss and later regret:</p><ul><li>VRM quality</li><li>Cooling performance and noise</li><li>Case airflow</li><li>Real PSU reliability</li><li>Memory pairing and avoiding bottlenecks</li></ul><p>If you care about long-term value, I can also plan a smart <strong>upgrade path</strong>, so you buy wisely today and expand easily later.</p><p>You don't just get a recommendation, you get a clear explanation: why these parts, what you gain by spending more (and where you shouldn't), plus alternative options if availability or pricing changes.</p><p><strong>The goal is simple:</strong> you make a calm, informed decision and end up with a PC that works the way you expect.</p><p>If you want, I can build a full parts list from scratch, recommend the most cost-effective upgrade for your current PC, or optimize a purchase for a specific goal (higher FPS, faster rendering, heavy multitasking, quieter operation, or compact builds). <strong>Your needs come first</strong>, I handle the rest.</p>",

        '<p>I build PCs from start to finish so you get a machine that <strong>just works</strong> right out of the box — stable, well cooled, quiet, and ready for work or gaming without the stress.</p><p>This is not just putting parts together, it is a careful process where the details matter for noise levels, temperatures, and long-term reliability.</p><p>What I pay special attention to:</p><ul><li>Safe, proper installation of every component</li><li>Clean cable management for better airflow and a tidy look</li><li>Making sure everything is seated and connected exactly as it should be</li></ul><p>After the build, I set up the <strong>BIOS/UEFI basics</strong>, including memory settings, then test stability under load and monitor temperatures to catch issues before you ever see them.</p><p>If you want, I can also deliver the PC <strong>fully ready</strong> — with the operating system, drivers, and essential software installed, so you can start using it immediately.</p><p>You get more than a finished PC, you get <strong>peace of mind</strong> that it was built properly, tested, and prepared for years of smooth use.</p>',
