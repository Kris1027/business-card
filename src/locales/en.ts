      shortDescription: 'Professional guidance in selecting computer components',
      longDescription:
        'I help you choose computer hardware so you can feel confident you’re buying exactly what you need, without overpaying, without frustrating compromises, and without spending hours digging through conflicting advice online. I treat consulting like a real project: first I understand your goals and priorities, then I design a setup (or an upgrade path) that stays fast, stable, and well-balanced for years. I start by analyzing how you actually use your PC: gaming (which titles and what resolution), work (Adobe apps, 3D, CAD, programming, data analysis), studying, streaming, as well as your monitor and peripherals, and your preferences like low noise, good temperatures, case size, and future upgradability. That’s why my recommendations aren’t generic parts lists, but tailored solutions with clear reasoning. Based on that, I compare components and suggest the best options within your budget: CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, PSU, cooling, and case. I verify compatibility and pay attention to details that people often miss and later regret, such as VRM quality, cooling performance and noise, case airflow, real PSU reliability, memory pairing, and avoiding bottlenecks so the whole system performs as it should. If you care about long-term value, I can also plan a smart upgrade path, so you buy wisely today and expand easily later. You don’t just get a recommendation, you get a clear explanation: why these parts, what you gain by spending more (and where you shouldn’t), plus alternative options if availability or pricing changes. The goal is simple: you make a calm, informed decision and end up with a PC that works the way you expect. If you want, I can build a full parts list from scratch, recommend the most cost-effective upgrade for your current PC, or optimize a purchase for a specific goal (higher FPS, faster rendering, heavy multitasking, quieter operation, or compact builds). Your needs come first, I handle the rest.',

      longDescription:
        'I build PCs from start to finish so you get a machine that just works right out of the box, stable, well cooled, quiet, and ready for work or gaming without the stress. This is not just putting parts together, it is a careful process where the details matter for noise levels, temperatures, and long term reliability. I focus on safe, proper installation of every component, clean cable management for better airflow and a tidy look, and making sure everything is seated and connected exactly as it should be. After the build, I set up the BIOS UEFI basics, including memory settings, then test stability under load and monitor temperatures to catch issues before you ever see them. If you want, I can also deliver the PC fully ready, with the operating system, drivers, and essential software installed, so you can start using it immediately. You get more than a finished PC, you get peace of mind that it was built properly, tested, and prepared for years of smooth use.',

        'I design and build modern websites that are fast, clear, and enjoyable to use, while genuinely supporting your goals, whether that is getting new clients, presenting your offer, booking a service, or building trust in your brand. Instead of making a nice looking page with no purpose, I focus on guiding visitors step by step, clearly explaining what you do, and making it easy to contact you. I take care of responsive design so everything works smoothly on both phones and desktops, cover the SEO basics so people can find you on Google, and keep the content structured so visitors instantly feel they are in the right place. If you need it, I can also help with copy, section layout, and practical features like a contact form, map, gallery, integrations, or analytics. You get a website that is polished, easy to manage, and ready to work for you, not a project that needs endless fixes or constant re explaining.',
